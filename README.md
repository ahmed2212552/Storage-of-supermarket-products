Storage of Supermarket Products
A C++ console-based application designed to manage and store supermarket products. The system uses a Doubly Linked List and a Binary Search Tree (BST) for product storage and retrieval, and a Queue to handle customer orders.
Features
- Add new products with ID, name, price, and quantity.
- Store products in both a linked list and a BST for efficient search and display.
- Search for products by ID.
- Delete products from both the list and BST.
- Display products from the linked list or from the BST (in-order traversal).
- Manage customer orders by adding them to a queue, processing them sequentially, and updating product stock after purchase.
How to Run
- Compile the program using a C++ compiler: g++ deviceinfo.cpp -o supermarket_storage
- Run the executable: ./supermarket_storage
